Ursla (UniveRsally Shitty Language)

An easy to parse and interpret language that can do some things. Plus ELECTROLYTES!

NO Tokenizing
NO Trees (ie. Parse Tree or AST)
NO Safety Nets

About those things it can do, here's a random list of features:

* Portability
    With a dirt simple syntax and minimal built-in function, it's easy to implement in another better language. Also, the compiler for Ursla is written in Ursla, so no additional porting is required.
* Logical expressions don't "short circuit"
    Sure it means the expressions are evaluated in full every time, but execution time will be constant!
* Integer literals can only be expressed using hexidecimal
    This may sound horrible but hey, at least it's not only base-10, so you can still spell out funny words in your numbers (ex. `+deadbeef`). just make sure numbers starting with a - f are prefixed with a `+` or the parser will freak out
* No whitespace
    Space or newline character indicate the end of a statement and that's it, so you don't have to decide how to space things.
* No string or map or boolean types
    Enjoy the charm of more rustic primitives.
* No classes!
    Who needs 'em when you have super fun coding patterns.
